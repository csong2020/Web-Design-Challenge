Module 11 Challenge

This challenge assignment, when run as a live server, will direct the user to a landing page that displays Latitude vs. X
In addition, it displays a dropdown navigation bar to go to specific plots, comparison graphs, and the data behind the images.
The comparison plots were provided in the started code and was not originally created.
These plots display data as it relates to latitude, including cloudiness, maximum temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
Window size was taken into consideration and the picture resizes itself if the window size changes.
